### Markdown themes for documents

In this repo you'll find the files I use to style the markdown files when converting them to HTML or PDF. Specifically, I use the [MarkText](https://github.com/marktext/marktext) markdown editor since its the one I find more usefull (while being **OSS**).

### Usage

In order to apply the styles of these files to your markdown you'll need the MarkText markdown editor. Download it from [here](https://github.com/marktext/marktext/releases) (available for MAC, Windows and even *Linux*!!).

Now that you have Marktext, in follow paste the files in this directory:

- Windows: ``%APPDATA%\marktext\themes\export``

- MAC: ``~/Library/Application Support/marktext/themes/export``

- Linux: ``$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/marktext/themes/export`` or ``~/.config/marktext/themes/export``

> :information_source: Note that the ``/themes/export`` sub-path might not exist, if that is the case, create it

### Preview of each theme

For previewing purposes, Im leaving some links to examples of how the markdown files look like once compiled.
